# NIA CARD Long Read Sequencing Allele-Specific Quantitative Trait Locus (QTL) Analysis Pipeline
Repository for the allele-specifc QTL pipeline developed by the CARD long-read sequencing/applied neurogenomics group.
## Pipeline overview
## Dependencies
## Containerization
## Variant filtering
We have initially filtered SNVs and SVs used for the allele-specific QTL analysis both to match filtering parameters used in [our past standard mQTL analyses](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.12.16.628723v1) and to reduce run time and significant variants to examine.
## Input data standardization
Input data for the QTL pipeline must be standardized in the formats listed in the [CARDlongread_data_standardization](https://github.com/NIH-CARD/CARDlongread_data_standardization) repository using the included scripts.
